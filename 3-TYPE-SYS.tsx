// Chapter 3- The Type System 

// The fundamental problem addressed by a type theory is to ensure that programs have meaning. The fundamental
// problem caused by a type theory is that meaningful programs may not have meanings ascribed to them. The 
// quest for richer type systems results from this tension.   - Mark Manasse
